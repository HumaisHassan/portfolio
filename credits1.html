                and I have taken the pictures and written story from:
                www.stcanicesschool.ie<br>
                
                I have taken the background image from Freepik.com
                and it had a free license.<br>
                
                I have used three fonts, Monserret Light, Henny Penny and
                Delius Swash Caps, I downloaded them from Google Fonts.<br>
                I have uploaded the links too at the end of this assignment (on website).
